## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I understood concepts related to flexbox while working on this challange. Designing and customizing the already available vector logos was a great source of practice of css basics.

Using media queries to enhance for the mobile first design was really interesting.

And how using svg's as bacground images directly was something really cool, which i didn't knew before:
```css
body{
    background-image:url(/images/bg-mobile.svg);
    background-color: hsl(257, 40%, 49%);
    font-size:1rem;
    color:white;
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight:400;
}
```


Moreover there are several more concepts which taught me much. Take a look at the repo to get an idea of those.
